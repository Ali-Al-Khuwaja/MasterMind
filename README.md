# MasterMind

If you’ve never played Mastermind, it’s a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs). Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.
